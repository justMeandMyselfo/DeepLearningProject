This model is the one with the highest accuracy, I had 93% accuracy after 13 epoch using CAP method, you need to train it on a GPU, 
I used google colab for that, it takes around an hour for one epoch on a T4 GPU, I would guess 15min on a A100.
Every function can be modified based on your needs but I believe I set them to their best. 

To use it with Google colab first download the dataset food101N (around 7GB) and the class folder in your drive
(much faster to work that way), then on colab import it from your drive with "import from drive", then split the dataset in two,
training set and valiadtion set with "train-validation sets", and last but not least run "main" so that it starts training.

You can use the Nutrition5K dataset from a Google Team for meal and not just food (dataset is around 195GB).
An improvement I would add is SAM from MetaAI and then I would host the model on client side so that it is much faster 
and then I would call it from a smartphone.

Sadly, after Papers with code sunsetted, I can not find the paper I used to build that project, so credit to X for the functions 
I got from him and then modified.
